# Global Electronics Retailer: Strategic Performance Audit & Growth Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive **strategic performance audit** and **growth analytics** for a global electronics retailer. By integrating multiple datasets (Customers, Products, Sales, Stores, and Exchange Rates), I developed an executive-level dashboard in Tableau Public to analyze revenue performance, profitability by category, product performance, and geographical trends.

The primary goal is to identify high-performing categories, top-selling products, and key growth opportunities to support data-driven strategic decisions.

## 🗂️ Data
The dataset was obtained from Maven Analytics: [Global Electronics Retailer](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/global-electronics-retailer)

The analysis was performed using **five interconnected CSV datasets**:
- `Sales.csv` – Transaction-level sales data
- `Products.csv` – Product details and categories
- `Customers.csv` – Customer demographic information
- `Stores.csv` – Store location data
- `Exchange_Rates.csv` – Currency exchange rates for global standardization

All datasets were joined within Tableau Public for seamless multi-table analysis.
